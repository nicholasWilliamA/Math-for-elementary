# Accelist Expo Starter

> React Native Expo project starter template for PT. Accelist Lentera Indonesia

## Getting Started

[Download The Template as Zip File](https://github.com/accelist/expo-starter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Unzip and rename the folder to your actual project name.

Run `npm ci` in the project root folder, then `npm run dev` (Run TypeScript + ESLint file watcher. Do this in Visual Studio Code Terminal) and `npm run start` (Run Expo development server. Do this in new console)

A QR Code should be displayed from `npm run start` console. Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) from iOS or Android and scan the QR Code (e.g. using the Camera app in iOS) to run the mobile app.

To display ESLint errors in Visual Studio Code, install [the official ESLint extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
